      <p>Human language requires unspoken assumptions. Have you ever texted someone and they mistook the intent in what you wrote? Assumptions are useful because we don&rsquo;t have the time or capacity to explain everything in perfect detail, but when building tools or working on complex problems, unspoken assumptions show up as delays, budget overruns, or missed expectations. L-ide is a logic-driven module that takes your natural language &mdash; plans, prompts, briefs, etc. &mdash; and turns it into a clear map of assumptions, dependencies, and open questions. An L-ide map gives project managers, C-suite leaders, and AI engineers true clarity.</p>

        <h3>Assumption API &mdash; for technical teams</h3>
        <p>Drop L-ide into your agent stack to translate prompts, specs, or git issues into structured assumption graphs. Your services can query the graph to detect conflicts, surface missing data, or gate risky deploys before execution. It becomes a shared truth layer that keeps autonomous systems honest.</p>

        <h3>Alignment briefings &mdash; for project leads</h3>
        <p>Run L-ide on kickoff docs, meeting notes, or quarterly plans and instantly see the hidden dependencies, bets, and open questions. Project managers can annotate, resolve, or assign each assumption, giving stakeholders a living brief that evolves as decisions land.</p>

        <h3>The Real Risk Isn&rsquo;t The Plan &ndash; It&rsquo;s The Assumptions Underneath It</h3>
        <p>Most plans look clean on paper, but they quietly depend on dozens of unspoken assumptions: about data quality, team capacity, stakeholder priorities, or even how an AI model will behave. Those assumptions stay invisible until something breaks &ndash; a deadline slips, a budget explodes, or a pilot fails. L-ide brings those assumptions to the surface before they hurt you.</p>

        <h3>Turn Natural Language Into A Logic Map</h3>
        <p>L-ide takes the way you already talk and write &ndash; project briefs, strategy docs, prompts, Slack threads &ndash; and translates it into a structured logic map.</p>
        <p>That map highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The assumptions you&rsquo;re currently making</li>
          <li>The constraints you&rsquo;ve declared (or implied)</li>
          <li>The dependencies between different parts of the plan</li>
          <li>The gaps, conflicts, and open questions that need a decision</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Built For People Who Need Clarity, Not Just Noise</h3>
        <p>L-ide is built for people who are accountable for outcomes, not just activity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project managers can keep work aligned with real constraints instead of wishful thinking.</li>
          <li>C-suite and leadership can see the logic behind a plan before they commit budget and reputation.</li>
          <li>AI engineers and data teams can turn high-level intent into clear, testable assumptions their systems can actually work with.</li>
        </ul>

      <article class="section-card">
        <h3>Fewer Surprises, Faster Decisions, Better Projects</h3>
        <p>With L-ide, you spend less time untangling misunderstandings and more time solving the real problem. Assumptions become visible, decisions become traceable, and teams &ndash; human or AI &ndash; can align on what &ldquo;success&rdquo; actually means before they start building.</p>
